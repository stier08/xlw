The default install of Visual Studio ( C++, C# or VisualBasic) does not show the
  the build configuration at the top as is the case for the Professional Edition.
    This can be changed by going to Tools->Options then checking the box 'Show All Settings'.
    Then from the menu in the list on the left select 'Projects and Solutions -> General'
    then check boxes "Show advanced build configurations' and 
    'Show Output window when build starts'

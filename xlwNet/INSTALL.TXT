1.PRE-REQUISITE
===============

  1.1 Visual Studio environment
  -----------------------------

   Developing with xlwDotNet requires one of the following Microsoft Visual Studio environments :

   1. MicroSoft Visual Studio 2008 with both C++ and C# installed.                      (VS9_PRO) 
   2. MicroSoft Visual Studio 2005 with both C++ and C# installed.                      (VS8_PRO) 
   3. Visual Studio 2008 Express Editions C++ & Visual Studio 2008 Express Editions C#  (VS9_EXPRESS)
   4. Visual Studio 2005 Express Editions C++ & Visual Studio 2005 Express Editions C#  (VS8_EXPRESS)

   There is no support for Visual Studio 2002 & 2003 and none is planned.


     1.1.1 Extra requirement with Visual Studio 2005 Express Edition.
     ''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
     If your development enviroment is VS8_EXPRESS (4) you will also need to install the Microsoft Platform SDK,
     available from :
 
      http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=A55B6B43-E24F-4EA3-A93E-40C0EC4F68E5&displaylang=en

     Once this is installed, you need to set a new environment variable, PSDK, assigned the path of the newly installed SDK.
     For me the Path is  :

          PSDK = C:\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v6.1


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2.INSTALLING XLWDOTNET
======================

   2.1 Obtaining xlwDotNet
   -----------------------
   At the moment you need to checkout the xlwNet branch of the xlw source tree from the sourceforge SVN repositry.
   The instructions and exact location can be found on Sourceforge.
   Source tree root will then look as follows.
   
   xlwnet
         |_____xlw
         |        |__build
         |        |__dev_tools
         |        |__docs
         |        |__examples
         |        |__include
         |        |__InterfaceGenerator
         |        |__lib
         |        |__src
         |        |__ ..... some files
         |
         |__xlwNet
         |         |__DotNet
         |         |__lib
         |         |__ ... some files
	 |
         |__xlw-site

 

   2.2 Adding the XLW Enviromnet Variable
   --------------------------------------
   You need to create a new enviroment variable XLW. This environment value must be set to the value of
   the path to xlwnet (inclusive of xlwnet), the root of the source code tree. For me this is 
           XLW = C:\xlwdownload\xlwnet
   


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.BUILDING XLWDOTNET
====================

   2.1 Building xlw
   ----------------

   xlw is a pre-requisite for xlwDotNet and therefore must be built first.

   If you environment is VS9_PRO or VS9_EXPRESS then you will find the VS Solution file xlw.sln
   in xlwnet\xlw\build\vc9
   
   If you environment is VS8_PRO or VS8_EXPRESS then you will find the VS Solution file xlw.sln
   in xlwnet\xlw\build\vc8  

   Build xlw.sln and its best to have both Debug and Release builds.


   2.2 Building xlwDotNet
   ----------------------
   In directory xlwnet\xlwNet\DotNet\Build you will find 2 sub-directories :
       VS9
       VS8

   In the directory corresponding to your version of Visual Studio, you will find the Solution xlw.NET.sln
   Build this, preferably in both Build & Release.

   
   
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. THE EXAMPLE 
==============

   3.1 Building The Example
   ------------------------
   In directory xlwnet\xlwNet\DotNet\Example you will find 2 directories :
       VS9
       VS8
     

   In the directory corresponding to your version of Visual Studio, you will find the Solution Example.sln
   Build this in Debug. Ensure that the configuration is indeed set to Debug.

  
   3.2 Setting the Path 
   ---------------------
   In the directory xlwnet\xlwNet\DotNet\Example\VS*\Debug (where * corresponds to your Visual Studio environment)
   you should see, amongst others, the following files 

       Example.NET.dll
       ExampleC.dll
       Example.xll
       xlwDotNet-vc**-mt-gd.dll


   Some of these DLLs have to be found by excel at runtime. so will add the directory to the path.
   Append xlwnet\xlwNet\DotNet\Example\VS*_***\Debug to the Path variable.
  
(---- Note to developers, we can automate this step, do we want to ? -----)

   3.3 Setting the Assembly search Path 
   ------------------------------------
   In the directory xlwnet\xlwNet\DotNet\Example\VS*\Debug (where * corresponds to your Visual Studio environment)
   you should see, amongst others, the following file

       Excel.exe.config
  
   Feel free to examine this file ( its an XML file and you can open it with a web browser) 
   This identifies the location of some Assemblies. Copy this file to the directory containing the excel.exe executable,
   for me this is :

       C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office12

   Now you can open Example.xll and the spread-sheet xlwnet\xlwNet\DotNet\Example\Example.xls.
   You see that some the functions being evaluated.
  
(--- Note to the developer  : This step can be automated also, again do we wat to ? ----)  

  
 Steps 3.3 & 3.4 only have to be done after the first build, then you can continue to play with the Example and
building the xll without having to do those steps. 
The only time you will have to repeat steps 3.3 & 3.4 are when :

1.  You Do a Release Build. ( since you will want the Release directory on your Path not the Debug AND your new Assembly
                              search path is the Release directory and not the Debug directory)

2.  You build the xll under a different VS enviroment ( for similar reason to 1)

3.  You add an extra Assembley to your Project. You may for example have existing C# Assembly which you would like 
    to reference in you DotNet Project ( the project containg your C# functions being exported to Excel).
    Then when you build, your new Excel.config.exe file have a reference to this new Assembly that Excel needs to find.
    So you  need to copy the Excel.onfig.exe file to the same Directory as your Excel.exe executable overwritinng the original.

    

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


4. YOUR OWN XLL
===============

   4.1 Obtaining the Template Project
   ----------------------------------

   In directory xlwnet\xlwNet\DotNet\Template you will find 2 sub-directories :
       VS9 
       VS8

   Copy the directory corresponding to your Visual Studio environment to wherever you would like to place
   the source code for your new xll project. Preferably do not make it a sub directory of the xlw source tree.

    4.2 Naming your Library
   ------------------------
   
   The name of you xll addin and associated libraries, will be taken from the names of the Visual Studio Solutions NOT the
   constituent Visual Studio Projects.
   We will change the name in 3 places.

   i.   Change the name of the directory you have just copied in 4.1 from VS* to MyLib, replacing MyLib 
        with the name of your Library.
   
   ii.  In this directory  You will find a C# Solution file called Template.sln, change the name to MyLib.sln
        replacing MyLib  with the name of your Library.

   iii. Also in this directory you will find a sub-directory Addin, in this sub directory you will see a C++ Solution file
        Template.sln. Change the name of this to MyLib.Sln  replacing MyLib  with the name of your Library.

   iv.  You can now open with Visual Studio the original renamed Solution file (i.e the one u renamed in (ii) )
        Build this  Solution to see if everything is ok. If not check your variable XLW is set correctly.

   v.   Now follow steps 3.2 and 3.3 but with the Debug directory in your project.

   
   4.3 Adding your own functions
   -----------------------------

   The parameter and return types of you functions can be :

     MyMatrix
     MyArray
     double[]
     double[,]
     string
     double
     int
     CellMatrix
     ArgumentList


   When you write your functions :

   i.   Decorate each function with the attribute
        [ExcelExport("function description goes here")]

   ii.  Decorate each parameter with the attribute
        [Parameter("parameter description goes here ")]

   iii. Ensure the function is public and static. Ensure that the
        method is in a Public class.

   iv.  The C# Assembley containing the code is a Class Library
 

   A function would then look like this :

        [ExcelExport("returns the diff of two cell ranges")]
        public static CellMatrix DiffRange(
                 [Parameter("The first  Cell Range")] CellMatrix A,
                 [Parameter("The second Cell Range")] CellMatrix B
                   )
          {
            ....
          }
  
   
   Your functions must be Public & static and in a Public class.



Thats it for now

ENJOY !!!!


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5. TroubleShooting 
==================

1. Everytime you open the xll in Excel it complains that it cannot recognise the format of the file.

   Firstly ensure that directoru into which your DLLs and XLL are bult is on your Path. If you have already got
   Excel open , close it and re-open it otherwise the new value for the Path is not seen. 
   I tend to get this error ( almost always ) when one of the Dlls that your XLL relies on cannot be found, and 
   this is the directory containg it is not on the Path.

2. You Open Excel, open you XLL addin and everything seem to work fine. You can even see all your addin functions
   in the function List under the Category with the same name as your Library. BUT if you try to evaluate any function, 
   Excel crashes.

   Most likely Excel can not find your Assemblies, ensure you have the correct Excel.config.exe in the directory containg
   the Excel.exe executable. 

    
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


6. Other Features.
=================

1. Hybrid library . With both C# AND C++ functions.

   This is in fact what I have for my own use and it is very easy to setup. NO extra developemnt is required just tinkering
   with the project files I plan to add this feature for the end-user after the current setup is tested and deemed close
   to first release.

2. A program that gets built alongside the xll and into the same directory, which when run automaticaly sets up the Path and
   automaticaly puts Excel.config.exe into the excel directory. 

   Lets see if we really want this first. Also we may not want to overider the Excel.config.exe file but rather append to it

3. An extra attribute on exportable functions, 'Long Description' and an program that can use reflection on an assembly
   reading the attributes on the exported function, producing on the ly documenation.

   This would be VERY useful, just need the time to do it :-)

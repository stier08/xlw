XLW now supports VC7, VC8 and VC9. The xlw library generated are named
xlw+toolset+threading+runtime+version.lib, where toolset can be -vc71 / -vc80 /
-vc90, threading can be -mt or nothing, runtime can be -s for static or nothing
(with a trailing gd for debug runtime and debug enabled code), and version is
3_0_0

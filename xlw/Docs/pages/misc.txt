\section ErrorHandling Error Handling
All the assertions are wrapped inside macros located in the file ERR_Macros.h.
They default to a naive message box reporting scheme, but you can change 
these freely to adapt them to your own error handling mechanism.

\section STL Note on STL
Some class member implements STL-like iterators that ease interfacing with 
your existing application. This integration is however not complete and not 
all features of STL container are implemented. I typically implement enough
to allow the use of the copy algorithm (i.e. begin(), end(), iterators, and
const_iterators).

\section inl .inl files
The .inl files contain inline methods. The .inl files are either included by
the source file (.cpp) in DEBUG mode or included at the end of the header file 
(.h) in release mode. This way you get the flexibility and short build times 
when you make a DEBUG release and the speed for the NDEBUG release.

\section inst_download Download and Installation

Get the source code installer from the
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=45222">downloads page</a>.
Run the installer to uncompress XLW to your hard drive.  The installation
includes source code, documentation and examples.

\section inst_build Build

The supported compilers are VC7, VC8, VC9, and Dev-C++.  Start the compiler of
your choice, load the corresponding project file from the appropriate
subdirectory of the build directory, and build the project.  The XLW static
library is output to the lib directory, and example XLLs are created in the
examples subdirectories.  The output files are named according to the 
\ref conv_binaries "boost naming conventions".

\section inst_ig InterfaceGenerator

The InterfaceGenerator is a utility which parses the header files of your C++
application and autogenerates the source code for the corresponding XLW Excel
addin (XLL).  First you must compile the InterfaceGenerator executable itself.
An example of its use is provided in directory examples\\autogenerated -
InterfaceGenerator parses file Test.h and outputs file xlwTest.cpp.

The installation includes the autogenerated file xlwTest.cpp that corresponds
to the existing Test.h.  You can edit Test.h and rerun the InterfaceGenerator
to observe the changes in the resulting xlwTest.cpp file.  The Visual C++
solutions include the NMAKE project RunInterfaceGenerator which detects
changes in Test.h and re-runs InterfaceGenerator as necessary.  If using
Dev-C++, you can use the DOS batch file build\\devcpp\\run_ig.bat to rerun the
InterfaceGenerator.

\section inst_examples Examples

The installation provides two example projects.  The first is the original
example that was created for XLW version 1.  The second is a new example which
is autogenerated by the InterfaceGenerator.  To run the examples:
\li Start Excel
\li Load the example workbook provided
\li Load the corresponding XLL that was created by the build
\li Hit Ctrl-Alt-F9 to force a recalculation of all cells

\section inst_usage Usage

To use XLW for your own project, configure the build for your project to use the
XLW directories for header and lib files.

You can pick up all of the XLW header files by adding the following directive
to the source file of your application:
\code
#include <xlw/xlw.h>
\endcode

You need to link to the XLW static lib file that you created when you compiled
XLW.  If you are using Visual C++, then the link is established automatically
by this directive in file config.msvc.h:
\code
#pragma comment(lib, XLW_LIB_NAME)
\endcode

If you're using Dev-C++ then you need explicitly to specify the dependency on
the XLW static library in the compiler options.

Have you ever programmed in C or C++ an algorithm that you needed to test on a
large number of values?  Have you ever wanted to quickly calibrate the
arguments of your estimation?  Have you ever wished that you could easily
graph your results and integrate the output into a word processing document?
If so, you might be interested in the XLW package.

XLW wraps the C API described in \ref XLSDK97 in a few classes that make API
programming with Excel much, much easier.  This powerful yet simple (a few
lines of code as demonstrated in the \ref gettingstarted section) interface
empowers your C or C++ numerics by embedding them in Excel just like the built
in functions, allowing you to exploit Excel features such as graphs, solvers,
and integration with the rest of the Microsoft Office suite.  The package
includes documentation and examples and is \ref download "downloadable" free
of charge provided that you retain the \ref copyright "copyright notice".

The XLW project is hosted on SourceForge at
<a href="http://xlw.sourceforge.net/">http://xlw.sourceforge.net/</a>.
XLW is a mature and stable package which has been tested and used over many
years in a wide variety of configurations.  The library is not perfect but has
certainly established its usefulness.  If you have any comments, you can email
xlw-users@lists.sourceforge.net.  Suggestions, improvements and criticisms of
the software and documentation are always welcome.

Debugging ability is imperative !!!


To debug an addin :

1. Open Visual Studio with your .NET project open ( but ensure your Path is already set to
   directory where your build output will go)

2. In Project settings Got to Debug

   i. Check 'Start external program' and browse and select to your excel executable 
      ( mine is C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office12\EXCEL.EXE )

  ii. Towards the bottom of the page check "Enable unmanaged code debugging"

THATS IT !!
Debug away !!



If when you try to open you .xll in Excel you get an error message that it doesn't recognise 
the format, its probablu because your Paths is not set correctly to the output directory. 
Close VS, set the path and try again

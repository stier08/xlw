YOUR OWN XLL
===============

   1 Obtaining the Template Project
   ---------------------------------

   In directory xlwnet\xlwNet\DotNet\Template you will find 2 sub-directories :
       VS9 
       VS8

   Copy the directory corresponding to your Visual Studio environment to wherever you would like to place
   the source code for your new xll project. Preferably do not make it a sub directory of the xlw source tree.

   2 Naming your Library
   ----------------------
   
   The name of you xll addin and associated libraries, will be taken from the names of the Visual Studio Solutions NOT the
   constituent Visual Studio Projects.
   We will change the name in 3 places.

   i.   Change the name of the directory you have just copied in 4.1 from VS* to MyLib, replacing MyLib 
        with the name of your Library.
   
   ii.  In this directory  You will find a C# Solution file called Template.sln, change the name to MyLib.sln
        replacing MyLib  with the name of your Library.

   iii. Also in this directory you will find a sub-directory Addin, in this sub directory you will see a C++ Solution file
        Template.sln. Change the name of this to MyLib.Sln  replacing MyLib  with the name of your Library.

   iv.  You can now open with Visual Studio the original renamed Solution file (i.e the one u renamed in (ii) )
        Build this  Solution to see if everything is ok. If not check your variable XLW is set correctly.

   3 Setting the Path 
   -------------------
   In the directory xlwnet\xlwNet\DotNet\Example\VS*\Debug (where * corresponds to your Visual Studio environment)
   you should see, amongst others, the following files 

       Example.NET.dll
       ExampleC.dll
       Example.xll
       xlwDotNet-vc**-mt-gd.dll


   Some of these DLLs have to be found by excel at runtime. so will add the directory to the path.
   Append xlwnet\xlwNet\DotNet\Example\VS*_***\Debug to the Path variable.
  

   4 Adding your own functions
   -----------------------------

   The parameter and return types of you functions can be :

     MyMatrix
     MyArray
     double[]
     double[,]
     string
     double
     int
     CellMatrix
     ArgumentList


   When you write your functions :

   i.   Decorate each function with the attribute
        [ExcelExport("function description goes here")]

   ii.  Decorate each parameter with the attribute
        [Parameter("parameter description goes here ")]

   iii. Ensure the function is public and static. Ensure that the
        method is in a Public class.

   iv.  The C# Assembley containing the code is a Class Library
 

   A function would then look like this :

        [ExcelExport("returns the diff of two cell ranges")]
        public static CellMatrix DiffRange(
                 [Parameter("The first  Cell Range")] CellMatrix A,
                 [Parameter("The second Cell Range")] CellMatrix B
                   )
          {
            ....
          }
  
   
   Your functions must be Public & static and in a Public class.

.......................................................................................................................
Steps 4 only has to be done after the first build, then you can continue to work with your code and
building the xll without having to do those steps. 
The only time you will have to repeat steps 3 & 4 are when :

1.  You Do a Release Build. ( since you will want the Release directory on your Path not the Debug )

2.  You build the xll under a different VS enviroment ( for similar reason to 1)

.............................................................................................................................



Thats it for now

ENJOY !!!!


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5. TroubleShooting 
==================

1. Everytime you open the xll in Excel it complains that it cannot recognise the format of the file.

   Firstly ensure that directoru into which your DLLs and XLL are bult is on your Path. If you have already got
   Excel open , close it and re-open it otherwise the new value for the Path is not seen. 
   I tend to get this error ( almost always ) when one of the Dlls that your XLL relies on cannot be found, and 
   this is the directory containg it is not on the Path.

2. You Open Excel, open you XLL addin and everything seem to work fine. You can even see all your addin functions
   in the function List under the Category with the same name as your Library. BUT if you try to evaluate any function, 
   Excel crashes.

   Most likely Excel can not find your Assemblies. 
   Ensure all the dependant Assemblies are in the same directory as the XLL 


3. You addin just refuses to load. 
   Some versions of Excel do not load the correct .NET Runtime. We are
   using .NET 3.5 and I believe Excel 2002 does not load this at startup,
   where as Excel 2007 does. There is a work around for this.
   Create a file called Excel.exe.config with contents :
   
    <?xml version="1.0"?>
    <configuration>
	<startup>
		<supportedRuntime version="v2.0.50727" />
	</startup>
    </configuration>

   and put it in the same directory as the excel executable.

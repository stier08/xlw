You need to install IronPython from 
   http://ironpython.codeplex.com/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=12481

Then you need to make sure the Ironpython asemblies are referenced correctly in your DotNet project.
By default they will be refernced from 
          C:\Program Files\IronPython 2.0.1

But if you installed your IronPython elswwhere or you have a differnt version you need to re-refernce them. 
In your DotNet project in Visual STudio you will see 'References', thats where you need to do it.



Still need to do the VS9 Project

Will follow up this example with more documentation

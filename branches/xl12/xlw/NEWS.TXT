XLW now supports VC6 and VC7. The xlw library generated are named
xlw+toolset+threading+runtime+version.lib, where toolset can be -vc6 or -vc71,
threading can be -mt or nothing, runtime can be -s for static or nothing (with a
trailing gd for debug runtime and debug enabled code), and version is 1_2_3

xlw is a tool originally created by Jérôme Lecomte (xlw@ifrance.com).
The original version was available at http://www.ifrance.com/xlw/

Ferdinando Ametrano (nando@ametano.net) made minor modifications and
moved the project to SourceForge for further development: http://xlw.sf.net

Mark Joshi updated it various ways and added automatic interface generation.

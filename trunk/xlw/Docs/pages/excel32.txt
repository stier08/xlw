Have you ever programmed an algorithm in C or C++ you needed to test
on a large number of values? Did you ever want to quickly calibrate
the parameters of your estimation? Did you ever wish you could
graph your output in no time and integrate your work in a word
document with even less effort?  If you do (or did), you might
be interested in the excel32 C++ wrapper package.

The excel32 C++ wrapper package wraps the C API described in \ref XLSDK97
in a few classes that make API programming with Excel much, much simpler.
This simple (a few lines of code as demonstrated in the \ref gettingstarted
section), yet powerfull interface will empower your C or C++ numerics by
embeding them in Excel (just like the built in functions); and let you
benefit from its powerfull functionalities, including graphs, solver, or
integration with the rest of the Microsoft office suite. These classes are
thoroughly documented and \ref download "downloadable" free of charge as
long as you retain the \ref copyright "copyright notice".

The excel32 C++ wrapper package development is hosted on SourceForge at
http://sf.net/projects/xlw
Early versions of this package have been used for years. The version 1.0 was tested
under Windows 9X/NT with Visual C++ 6.0 and Excel 97 \ref sr1 "SR-1 & SR-2"
with minor problems (see \ref knownbugs) The package is not perfect but
certainly has reached a stage where it can be usefull. If you have
any comment, you can email to xlw-users@list.sourceforge.net
Suggestions, improvements and critics to the software
and/or the documentation are heartily welcome.

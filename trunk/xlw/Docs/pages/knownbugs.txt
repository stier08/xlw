- The comment line of the last argument is sometimes cut by one or
two characters at the end. The risk seem to grow if your function
has many arguments.
- It is not possible to unregister a function due to a bug in Microsoft
Excel C API (according to \ref XLSDK97). In practice, it is rarely a 
problem.
- You can't pass character strings longer than 255 characters between
Excel and your XLL.
- References passed to the XLL are limited to 256 columns.

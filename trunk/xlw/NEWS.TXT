- added nsi file for Win32 installer generation. The installer also set the
  environment variable XLW_DIR pointing to your xlw installation folder.
  This way any project based on xlw can add "$(XLW_DIR)" to the "Additional
  include directory" list and add "$(XLW_DIR)\lib\Win32\VisualStudio\" to the
  "Additional library path" list.
- moved sources under xlw folder, and switched to <xlw/xxx.h> inclusion
  style (library suggested standards, at least by GNU)
- added LICENSE.TXT, NEWS.TXT, AUTHORS.TXT, CONTRIBUTORS.TXT, HISTORY.TXT,
  ChangeLog.TXT, and README.TXT files in the project root
- moved test file main.cpp under test folder
- added config.msvc.h to handle all the MS VC defines. Now as long as you
  include <xlw/excel32.h>, you won't have to explicitly link your
  application to excel32.lib. This is automatically done by excel32.h using
  the pragma statement:
  #ifdef _DEBUG
      #pragma comment(lib,"excel32_d.lib")
  #else
      #pragma comment(lib,"excel32.lib")
  #endif
- Visual Studio setting changed from Multithread to Multithread DLL
- defined EXCEL32_NOIMPORTEXPORT in order to avoid classes being exported as
  __dlldecl(*) when creating a static library with Multithreaded DLL
  run-time libraries
- added two VC++ build configurations. The "Win32 OnTheEdgeRelease" and
  "Win32 OnTheEdgeDebug" configurations are equivalent to "Win32 Release"
  and "Win32 Debug" respectively, except that they do not use the installed
  xlw libraries, but look for the *.h, *.inl, and *.lib xlw files in a
  relative ..\xlw path. This is mainly for xlw developers, to allow them to
  check the examples without having to install their unstable working
  version of xlw.
  The "OnTheEdge" approach may be adopted in projects using xlw, allowing
  for a quick and easy way to check how the projects work with a new xlw
  release without having to install it.
- error handling polished in accord to C++ standard
- modified EXCEL32_API.h
- purged port.h of unnecessary defines
- introduced XLW_HEX_VERSION and XLW_VERSION
- added config.bcc.h for Borland CPP defines
- compiled xlw under borland (it doesn't work yet)
- the library debug version is called excel32d.lib
- test uses XLW_DIR environment variable to detect xlw installation
- test doesn't link excel32.lib anymore
- doxygen.cfg renamed as xlw.doxy, moved under Docs folder, and modified in
  order to account for the Docs folder
- updated to doxygen 1.2.14
- all *.txt documentation pages moved under Docs folder
- added CVS Id tag to all files
